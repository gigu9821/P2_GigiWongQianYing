# Streamlit Dashboard (Deployment)

This Streamlit application is the deployment component of the research project on  
**LLM-based Financial Sentiment Analysis and Market Signal Construction**.

The dashboard provides an interactive interface to demonstrate how financial news sentiment,
inferred using a large language model (Gemini), is transformed into a Daily Market Sentiment Index (DMSI)
and evaluated through quantitative backtesting.
